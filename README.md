# Overview  
FreeBSD_DocBot is an innovative tool designed to streamline your interaction with the FreeBSD operating system. By leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), LangChain, and Astra DB, this project provides a user-friendly interface to access and understand FreeBSD commands and configurations.  
1. Prompt-Based Interaction: Simply input your command request in plain language.
2. LLM Processing: The LLM analyzes your command and identifies the relevant FreeBSD command or concept.
3. Knowledge Base Access: LangChain efficiently retrieves information from the Astra DB, which stores a comprehensive knowledge base of FreeBSD documentation and commands.
4. Response Generation: The LLM generates a clear and concise response, explaining the command's syntax, usage, and potential output.
